This example show idea for joint fixed gain kamlan filter for state and parameter estimation (position and tire radius). Find examples in "tire-radius-estimator" folder exported for R2013b and 2016b
Usage:
1) start simulation and change in run time tire radius by the slider available at the left side on the model.
2) Investigate observer behavior by the scopes, pointers and displays available in simulator
